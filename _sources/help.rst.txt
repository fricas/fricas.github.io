of the mailing list.


We are well aware of the steep learning curve of |PACKAGE_NAME|. By
asking your questions you not only give you a chance to solve you
problem quickly, but also help us to improve |PACKAGE_NAME| by letting
us know of what a user finds hard to accomplish with the system.

Apart from `this website <https://fricas.github.io>`_ (in particular
the |PACKAGE_BOOK|) there is also help available locally.
We are working on a version of this website that you can use without
internet connection.

If you are working with |PACKAGE_NAME| in an operating system that has
the `X Window System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System>`_
available, you can find most of the information
in HyperDoc (see the |PACKAGE_BOOK| for more information about
HyperDoc), which is started when you start |PACKAGE_NAME|.

In a |PACKAGE_NAME| session there are special commands starting with a
closing parenthesis in the first column. You can get more information
about them by typing

::

  )help help

  )help set

In particular, for the `)set` command you can find the output
`here <http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/FriCASHelpSet>`_.
